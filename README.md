# Denicker
This is a JavaScript implementation of the last known Hypixel denicker (2021-2022) using Mineflayer and WebSockets, documented here for the sake of antiquity.

This denicker operated on the basis of visiting a player's skyblock island using the /visit command with the target player's UUID as the argument (e.g. /visit 4fef66aace5641b6b4b2bf272d765d9f), whereupon the target player's nick would be revealed in the skull item located within the visiting menu.
